# Colorbird - A new style for thunderbird that highlights the message tags.

I have made some modifications on the default theme of thunderbird in order to make it look nicer. Most importantly, I made changed the behavior of the tags column in order to highlight each tag cell with the color of the most important tag. I have also made some modifications to the background colors of the panels and to the fonts.

## Installation

To apply this theme copy the `chrome` folder of this repository under your thunderbird's profile folder (e.g., `~/.thunderbird/<profile>/.` or `~/.icedove/<profile>/.` in debian). Then, restart thunderbird for the new theme to take effect. Then, change the set of columns in the message list as below:
- Thread
- Star
- Attachments
- Read
- From
- Tag
- Junk Status
- Date

Below is a screenshot of the new style:
